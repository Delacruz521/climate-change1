            <h1>What is Climate Change</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Climate change is a shift in weather patterns and associated changes to the oceans, land surfaces, and ice sheets that take place over a period of decades or more. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Weather is the condition of the atmosphere throughout hours to weeks, including its temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall, and other factors. It is affected by the ice sheets, oceans, and land surfaces, which combined with the atmosphere make up what is known as the "climate system." The statistical description of the condition of the climatic system is referred to as climate, in its broadest definition.
                A change in the statistical characteristics of the climate system that lasts for several decades or longer—typically at least 30 years—is referred to as climate change. Averages, variability, and extremes are some of these statistical features. Climate change can result from both natural causes, such as variations in the Sun's radiation, volcanoes, or internal climate variability, as well as human impacts, including alterations in the atmosphere's composition or land usage.
                <br>
                <br>
                Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.</p>
